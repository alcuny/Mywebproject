The project uses gh-pages to host the website, so gh-pages needs to be installed.
Command for this is npm i gh-pages, then 
the project can be run by command: npm run deploy, which executes the scipt deploy in package.json file.

Alternatively you can use a live server extesion for vscode which allows to see the web page also. When you have installed the extension open the index.html file and right click, then u will have an option open with live server. Extension name: Live server By: Ritwick Dey.
